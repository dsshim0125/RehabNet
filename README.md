## RehabNet: Respiratory Pattern Estimation for Rehabilitation Robot via Transfer Learning
### B.S. Thesis @ Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University

### Abstract
Modeling and estimating human breathing motion is a quite challenging task because we cannot measure the volume change directly unless we attach sensors to the human lung. In this paper, we suggest GRU(Gated Recurrent Unit) based neural network that could estimate the respiratory pattern which could generate artificial response of human breath to the external forces. With these generated data, human breath could be modeled with parametrized differential equation like mass- spring-damper system.
