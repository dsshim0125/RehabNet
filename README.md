## RehabNet: Respiratory Pattern Estimation for Rehabilitation Robot via Transfer Learning
### B.S. Thesis @ Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University

### Abstract
Modeling and estimating human breathing mo- tion is a quite challenging task because we cannot measure the volume change directly unless we attach sensors to the human lung. In this paper, I suggest GRU(Gated Recurrent Unit) based neural network that could estimate the respiratory pat- tern which could generate artificial response of human breath to the external forces. With these generated data, human breath could be modeled with parametrized differential equation like mass- spring-damper system.
